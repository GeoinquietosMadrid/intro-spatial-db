# Introduction to pgAdmin 4

## What's pgAdmin? 

pgAdmin is a client application for PostgreSQL that works as a graphical interface for querying and managing our PostgreSQL database server. 

It's an Open Source community project, actively developed and maintained by the [pgAdmin Development Team](https://www.pgadmin.org/development/team/). There are versions for Linux, macOS and Windows, and more recently, also Python Wheel and Docker

There is plenty of information at the [official website](https://www.pgadmin.org), and also: 

* [Documentation](https://www.pgadmin.org/docs/)
* [Mailing list](https://www.pgadmin.org/support/list/)
* [Download](https://www.pgadmin.org/download/)
